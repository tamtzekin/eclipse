// Task 40 pre-queue authorization gate — the ONE place both transports ask
// "may this principal run this request?" before anything is enqueued.
//
// It lives in Core because it is the only layer allowed to see all three of the
// canonical capability catalogue (MCP/Gateway), the Task 22 console-command
// policy (Domains) and the shared Foundation predicates. Foundation stays free
// of those dependencies so its predicates remain unit-testable in isolation.
//
// Every refusal here happens BEFORE UMcpAutomationBridgeSubsystem::
// QueueAutomationRequest, so a refused request performs no editor work at all.
// The existing in-handler checks (console-command blocklist, path sanitizers)
// are deliberately left in place as post-queue defence in depth.
