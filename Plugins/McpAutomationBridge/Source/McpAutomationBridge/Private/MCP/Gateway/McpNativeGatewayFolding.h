// McpNativeGatewayFolding.h — folded capability families on the native door
//
// A folded record stands for a set of bridge actions that differ only by one
// selector value. Two data fields on the record drive the fold at execute time
// and nothing else does:
//   routing.dispatchBy    selector value -> bridge action, for a call that names
//                         the primary operation;
//   legacyIds[n].folded   the selector values an old name implied, for a call
//                         that still names the old action (or its alias id).
// Both doors apply the same two steps in the same order: the pins are injected
// before schema validation, the action is chosen after it. Mirror of
// src/server/gateway/gateway-dispatch-by.ts.
