// Task 41 principal-scoped idempotency ledger (native mirror of the TypeScript
// src/server/gateway/idempotency-ledger.ts, at 4096 entries rather than 1024).
//
// A slot is keyed by a SHA-256 digest over principal + capability + the client's
// idempotency key, so the raw key never enters the map and can never reach a log
// line, a receipt or an evidence file. Binding the principal into the digest is
// what stops one principal replaying, colliding with, or observing another's
// execution. The three fields are LENGTH-PREFIXED into the preimage rather than
// joined with a delimiter, so no crafted field can shift a boundary and merge two
// distinct scopes onto one slot; the TypeScript mirror builds the identical
// preimage, and both surfaces pin the same digest vectors in their tests.
//
// Two properties are load-bearing and match the TypeScript side exactly:
//   * A failure is NEVER recorded. Abandon() drops the slot outright, so a
//     transient error stays retryable and an authorization/validation/consent
//     refusal (which is refused before it ever reaches Begin) can never be
//     replayed as a successful receipt.
//   * Eviction only ever removes a COMPLETED entry. Dropping an in-flight entry
//     would admit a concurrent duplicate as a second real dispatch, which is
//     precisely the mutation this ledger exists to prevent.
//
// Locking: every method takes the mutex for a short, editor-free critical
// section and releases it before returning. Callers therefore hold no lock
// across dispatch, which is what keeps game-thread editor work off this lock.
//
// State is process-local and deliberately never persisted: after a restart the
// editor may have changed underneath a recorded receipt, so forgetting is the
// only safe behaviour.
