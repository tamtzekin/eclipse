# Changelog

All notable changes to the MCP Automation Bridge plugin will be documented in this file.

---

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Content ingestion — `manage_asset.list_content_sources` and `manage_asset.migrate_assets`.** Reusable content already on the machine was unreachable through the gateway: `asset.import` runs source-file importers and refuses any path outside the project directory, so an installed engine template or a Quixel Bridge / Fab pack could not be brought in at all. Bridge and Fab deliver cooked `.uasset` packs rather than source art, so ingestion is a package copy plus an asset-registry scan — the same operation that pulls in a template, which is why these are generic rather than Megascans-specific. `list_content_sources` enumerates engine templates, engine/plugin content, and downloaded Bridge packs; `migrate_assets` copies a tree into `/Game` with `dryRun` preview and a `maxPackages` cap. A migrate request never carries a filesystem path — it carries a root token (`engineTemplates`, `engineFeaturePacks`, `engineContent`, `enginePlugins`, `megascansLibrary`, `projectContent`, `projectPlugins`) plus a relative id, both resolved in `McpAutomationBridge_AssetWorkflowContentSourceRoots.h`, so no directory outside those roots is reachable. `destinationPath` defaults to `/Game` because reproducing the source layout is the only arrangement that keeps the `/Game/...` references stored inside the copied packages resolvable; anything deeper reports `referenceIntegrity: "at-risk"`.
- **Plugin management — `system_control.list_plugins`, `enable_plugin`, `disable_plugin`.** Migrated content usually depends on a plugin that is installed but disabled (ChaosVehicles for the advanced vehicle template), and without this the assets copy in and then fail to load their classes, which reads as a broken migration rather than a disabled module. Writes go through `IProjectManager::SetPluginEnabled` + `SaveCurrentProjectToDisk`; the response reports `restartRequired: true` because modules and content mount only at startup.
- **Native gateway surface** — the plugin's `/mcp` transport now exposes a single `unreal` tool with `search`, `describe`, `execute`, and `configure` operations, implemented by new `Private/MCP/{Gateway,Routing,Execute,Primitives,Resources,DynamicTools}/` modules.
- **Generated contract shards** — `Private/MCP/Generated/` and `Private/MCP/Tools/McpGeneratedParentRegistry*` are emitted from the TypeScript capability records by `npm run registry:generate`. They are committed but must never be hand-edited.
- **Native MCP protocol primitives** — `Private/MCP/Primitives/` adds the MCP Tasks surface (`McpTaskMethods`, `McpTaskStore`) for `2025-11-25`, a subscription store with a notification coalescer so bursts of editor changes collapse into one client notification, resource revision stamps, completion pools and provider, prompt catalog/render/argument validation, a client profile store and session capability profile, and an elicitation decision policy. The elicitation policy is metadata/decision only — no transport wiring, no server-initiated RPC, no new MCP method — and never marks a secret, token, credential, or destructive-confirmation value as safe to elicit. Cross-transport parity with the TypeScript primitives is audited by `npm run primitives:check`.
- **Protocol negotiation** — `McpSupportedProtocolVersions` accepts `2025-11-25` (latest), `2025-06-18`, and `2025-03-26`. `initialize` echoes the highest mutually supported version, or the latest for an unknown well-formed request; `McpDefaultProtocolVersion()` (`2025-03-26`) backs post-initialize requests that omit the `MCP-Protocol-Version` header.
- **Capability authorization primitives** — `Private/Foundation/McpCapabilityPrincipal`, `McpCapabilityAuthorization`, and `McpCapabilityPathScan` give the plugin its own authorization identity instead of trusting the caller's claim.
- **Idempotency ledger and compensation receipts** — `Private/Foundation/McpIdempotencyLedger` (cap 4096, mirroring the TypeScript ledger's cap of 1024) and `McpCompensationReceipt`.
- **`MCP_NATIVE_PORT` environment variable** — overrides the native MCP HTTP/SSE port (`NativeMCPPort`) at startup without editing committed ini, so a project can run several editors at once on distinct ports. Mirrors the existing `MCP_MAX_*` env overrides; falls back to the `Native MCP Port` project setting when unset or invalid.
- **`IKRigEditor` optional module** — declared for the `create_ik_rig` path so IK Rig creation does not require a hard dependency on the editor module.
- **Component-bound events in `add_event`** — pass `componentName` plus `eventName` (the delegate name) to wire a component's multicast delegate to a `UK2Node_ComponentBoundEvent` with `ComponentPropertyName`, `DelegatePropertyName`, and `DelegateOwnerClass` set. Idempotent on repeat calls; guarded by `MCP_HAS_K2NODE_COMPONENTBOUNDEVENT`.
- **Typed class pins in `create_node` / `add_node`** — dedicated branches assign `UK2Node_DynamicCast::TargetType` and `UK2Node_CreateWidget::WidgetType` from a `targetClass` payload, so casts and CreateWidget nodes come back typed instead of as wildcard/"Bad cast" nodes. Shared `ResolveTargetClassFromString` / `ReadTargetClassPayload` helpers accept the same input forms and legacy field fallbacks across every branch with a class pin.
- **18 widget-authoring actions added to the native `WidgetAuthoring()` routing array** — `add_quest_tracker`, `add_safe_zone`, `add_spacer`, `add_widget_component`, `add_widget_switcher`, `bind_localized_text`, `create_credits_screen`, `create_shop_ui`, `create_widget_style`, `delete_animation`, `get_widget_slot_info`, `remove_widget`, `rename_widget`, `reparent_widget`, `set_font`, `set_localization_key`, `set_margin`, `set_widget_binding`. The handlers existed but were unreachable because the action names were absent from the routing array; the TypeScript `WIDGET_AUTHORING_ACTIONS` set gained the same 18.
- Native cinematics, Movie Render Queue, media, Take Recorder, and replay automation with direct `/mcp`, WebSocket, and live-editor verification coverage.
- **Folded capability families on the native surface** — the native registry serves the same 377 folded records as the TypeScript surface: `McpNativeGatewayFolding` applies the folded pins before defaults and schema validation and resolves the dispatch action after them, `FindByParentAction` falls back to any legacy pair so every former `{tool, action}` name still resolves, and the native completion pool completes the old names. `describe` advertises each family once, with its selector.
- **Pre-queue capability gate** (`Core/Security/McpPrequeueGate`) — every request is authorized before it reaches the editor queue. The gate resolves its demand with the same `McpHandlerUtils::NormalizeAction` the dispatchers call, so the gate and the dispatcher cannot disagree about which capability a request needs.
- **Scoped capability tokens** — a scoped token carries its profile, scopes, allowed path prefixes, allowed projects and per-minute request/tool-call quotas, and the `bridge_ack` authority block reports the effective identity.
- **Principal-keyed quota ledger** (`McpPrincipalQuota`) — bounded to 256 tracked identities with least-recently-seen eviction, charged only after every other refusal, answering `QUOTA_EXCEEDED` as retryable.
- **Single-use consent nonces** — a consent grant is consumed by the request that used it; a replayed grant answers `CONSENT_REUSED`.
- **Typed refusals for stalls, state and addressability** — `EDITOR_BLOCKED` (game-thread stall over 15 s), `EDITOR_STATE_MISMATCH`, `STALE_STATE`, the `UNDO_UNAVAILABLE_*` family, and `OBJECT_NOT_ADDRESSABLE` from `McpSafeReflectionTarget`, which denies a reflected write to a target the principal cannot address so a `write`-scoped principal cannot reach `bRequireCapabilityToken` through `inspect.set_property`.
- **Bounded native sessions** — at most 16 active sessions with a 120 s idle reclaim, and a 32-connection ceiling that answers 503 beyond it.
- **User-defined action aliases** — a project can add action names in `handler-aliases.json` (schema `Resources/MCP/custom-handler-aliases.schema.json`, tests `Tests/McpCustomHandlerAliasTests.cpp`): version 1, at most 128 aliases and 64 KB, `lower_snake_case` only, resolved through three search paths; an alias pointing at another alias or at the protected `inspect`/`manage_tools` actions is rejected, and an alias whose target is not registered yet stays pending until it is.
- **Promoted skeleton routes** — the fifteen previously hidden skeleton routes (twelve promoted to canonical records, the three `delete_*` spellings still hidden) now carry explicit names on the native `Skeleton()` routing array.
- **Word-level native search with paging** — the native gateway search matcher scores word-level matches and accepts `actionOffset` and `maxBytes`, so a large action list can be paged.
- **Fab adapter module** — `McpAutomationBridgeFab` bridges the Fab asset store through the Fab plugin's own browser widget and download API (`McpFabBrowserBridge`, `McpFabSearchOperation`, `McpFabDetailsOperation`, `McpFabAddToProject`, `McpFabImportWatcher`). Its Fab and Megascans engine dependencies are declared optional and listed in `PublicDelayLoadDLLs` on Win64, so the module compiles away when they are absent; the store actions themselves are dispatched by `Domains/AssetWorkflow/`.
- **Diagnostics snapshot store** — `Foundation/Diagnostics/` records request admission, refusal, terminal, handshake and session events to `<Project>/Saved/MCP/diagnostics/`, with atomic temp+rename writes, previous-session rotation, and corrupt-file tolerance.

### Changed
- **Second dedup pass (2026-09-06)** — Navigation and Spline read payloads through the shared `GetJson*Field` / `ExtractVectorField` accessors (their private copies are gone), the material domain / blend mode / shading model chains in create_material and the three set_* handlers share `ParseMaterialDomain` / `ParseBlendMode` / `ParseShadingModel`, material and material-function info share `AppendMaterialFunctionIO`, `SetMainMaterialInputExpression` reuses `GetMainMaterialInput` (and now accepts WorldPositionOffset), Sequence track lookups share `FindTrackByName`, the container Property handlers share `McpPropertyReflection::AssignPrimitiveFromJson`, WidgetAuthoring animation and widget lookups share `FindWidgetAnimation` / `FindWidgetByName`, the thin `FMcpAutomationBridge_*` pin wrappers call `McpBlueprintUtils` directly, `blueprint.get` merges functions and events through one lambda, and the Niagara graph handler parses `scriptType` once.
- **Shared helpers replace copy-pasted lookups (2026-09-06)** — 56 Geometry handlers resolve their dynamic mesh through `ResolveDynamicMeshForGeometry` (null-world safe), MaterialAuthoring pin chains go through `ForEachMainMaterialInput` / `GetMainMaterialInput`, Sequence binding names through `GetBindingName`, Skeleton loads through `LoadSkeletonOrMeshSkeleton`, Spline handlers through one `FindSplineMeshComponent` / `ParseSplineMeshAxis`, SCS handlers through `FindSCSNodeByVariableName` / `FindSCSParentNode` / `IsSCSRootAlias`, Level handlers dropped their unused `HandleExecuteEditorFunction`-family macro pairs, and `manage_tools.get_status` reports the plugin descriptor version and generated registry counts instead of hardcoded values.
- **`Private/` reorganized into per-domain modules** — `Core/` (errors, requests, security, subsystem), `Domains/` (66 domain directories), `Foundation/` (blueprint, bridge helpers, handler utils, capability authorization, idempotency, compensation), `MCP/`, `Safety/`, and `Transport/`. The per-tool `McpTool_*.cpp` definitions, `McpDynamicToolManager.cpp`, `McpConsolidatedActionRouting.h`, and the `McpNativeTransport.{h,cpp}` monolith are gone, replaced by generated registries and `Private/MCP/Transport/`.
- **`Private/Safety/` split into per-operation headers** — asset save, level save, map load, folder delete (assets/verify), animation delete, delete quiesce/compilation, world delete, package tools, material, and classification each have their own header; `McpSafeOperations.h` survives only as a short umbrella that includes them.
- **`control_actor` spawn is now transactional** — a requested `meshPath` that can't be applied no longer leaves a misconfigured actor in the level: it fails `MESH_NOT_FOUND` before spawning if the mesh can't load, or rolls back (`Destroy()` + `MESH_APPLY_FAILED`) if a resolved mesh can't be applied to the spawned actor.
  - **Potentially breaking:** a request that passed a `meshPath` which failed to resolve previously still produced a spawned actor and a success response; it now returns a `MESH_NOT_FOUND` error and spawns nothing.
- Stripped redundant section and line comments across **254 files** (237 `.cpp`, 3 `.h`, 14 `.ts`), removing roughly 1,640 lines of banner and restating comments from the C++ domain handlers, the TypeScript handlers, and the capability records. Comments carrying information the code does not — including the `docs/Roadmap.md` section cross-references — were kept in condensed form.
- **Build configuration** — `PCHUsage = PCHUsageMode.UseExplicitOrSharedPCHs` replaces the `NoPCHs` setting, which made every unity blob re-parse the engine headers from scratch, with `PrivatePCHHeaderFile = "Private/Core/Module/McpAutomationBridgePCH.h"`; adaptive unity is disabled; `HTTP` and `GraphEditor` are dependencies; engine deprecation warnings are suppressed for this plugin's sources unless `MCP_STRICT_DEPRECATIONS=1` restores them for auditing (the opt-in packaging job sets it); `GameplayAbilities` and `SmartObjects` are required plugin dependencies rather than optional ones; and the `.uplugin` adds the `McpAutomationBridgeFab` module plus optional `MovieRenderPipeline`, `MoviePipelineMaskRenderPass`, `Takes`, `ElectraPlayer`, `Fab`, `Bridge`, `RigVM` and `GeometryProcessing` plugins.
- **`server-info.json` instructions** now describe the capability-first flow (377 capabilities covering 1,500+ editor actions) instead of the previous count.

### Removed
- **Unreachable and dead handlers (2026-09-06)** — `Blueprint/Graph/...SetDefaultObject.cpp` and the four `Blueprint/Components/Scs{SetTransform,RemoveComponent,ReparentComponent,SetProperty}.cpp` routes were shadowed by earlier routes; `Interaction/...RuntimeActors.cpp` and `...RuntimeComponents.cpp` plus their six subsystem declarations duplicated the namespace handlers that already claim those actions; `Effect/...NiagaraModuleRouting.cpp` held five `return false` stubs; `Performance/...ActorMergeSave.cpp`, `LevelStructure/...Actions.cpp` (log category moved next to its handlers), the empty `FoliageHandlers.cpp`, `NiagaraHandlers.cpp` and `PropertyHandlers.cpp` translation units, `Foundation/Render/McpRenderStateRefresh.{h,cpp}` (inlined at its only call site), `HandleSequenceGetMetadata`, `EnsureSequenceEntry` / `GSequenceRegistry`, `CopyExternalPackageDirectory`, `FindExpressionByPayload`, `LOAD_MATERIAL_OR_RETURN`-adjacent dead macros, the per-domain `GetStringField`/`GetNumberField`/`GetBoolField` copies in Misc, Networking and Texture (now the shared `GetJson*Field` accessors), `GetIntFieldSkel`, `SanitizeForLogConnMgr`, the three file-local `PersistSnapshotAsync` helpers (now `FMcpDiagnosticsSnapshot::PersistCurrentAsync`), nine dead consolidated routing sub-lists, and roughly a hundred orphan section banners and nested `#if WITH_EDITOR` arms across the domain handlers.
- **`Private/MCP/Gateway/McpNativeGatewayManifest.h`** (generated, 298 KB) is no longer emitted or committed. No translation unit has included it since the native gateway started serving describe from the generated parent registry, so it was dead weight in every build and every diff.
- **`Domains/EditorFunction/McpAutomationBridge_EditorFunctionHandlersActorComponents.cpp`** — its only function, `HandleActorComponentFunction` (`LIST_ACTOR_COMPONENTS`), was never reached by `HandleExecuteEditorFunction`.
- **Enable Native Gateway (`bEnableNativeGateway`) project setting** — the native transport permanently exposes only the `unreal` tool; there is no opt-out and no legacy 23-tool listing. A direct `tools/call` on a canonical parent name returns a bounded, executable `DIRECT_TOOL_CALL_REMOVED` receipt whose `nextCall` re-runs the request through the gateway.
- **The local-only progress log** — `docs/native-automation-progress.md` was a scratch log rather than published documentation and is dropped from the tree.

### Security
- Scopes are exact-set membership with an `Admin` wildcard, not rank-based — `Write` does not imply `Read`, and an unresolvable capability demands `Admin`.
- Consent arrives as an `automation_request` envelope sibling and is re-validated plugin-side; it is never inferred from loopback, a prior call, idempotency, or preview.
- Capability tokens compare in constant time and are never logged; the plugin re-enforces every check the TypeScript layer performs.
- Added continuous local output-path validation, disabled network-backed media URLs because redirect destinations cannot be pinned, added client-scoped native rate limits that survive session rotation, enforced strict native `manage_tools` argument validation, and sanitized streamed log payloads.
- **`action` and `subAction` can no longer disagree.** `AuthorizeAutomationRequest` normalizes any `automation_request` payload that declares both with different values (overwriting `action` from the authoritative `subAction`), and the native execute stage stamps `subAction` from the server-resolved action, so a client can neither lower its own scope nor raise what runs past what was authorized.
- **Capability-token auth is on by default** (`bRequireCapabilityToken`), the token is generated per install at `<ProjectRoot>/Saved/MCP/capability-token`, and both transports compare it with `McpConstantTimeTokenEquals` (`Foundation/McpSecureTokenCompare.h`) so comparison time never leaks how much of a token matched.
- **URL-looking arguments are refused** in handler validation, including loopback and `file:` URLs, rather than trying to allow a safe subset.
- **Scoped tokens are narrower than the legacy token by construction** — a scoped token may list only `Read`/`Write`/`Destructive` (never `Admin`), and a scoped token colliding with the legacy token wins because the narrower grant applies.

### Fixed
- **save_level_as on the unsaved Open World template** now answers `UNSAVED_TEMPLATE_LEVEL` instead of attempting a save that fails on private template references and asserts inside the world partition subsystem on the next frame (editor crash). `create_spline_actor` honours the declared `name` parameter (it only read the undeclared `actorName`).
- **Behaviour fixes found during the sweep (2026-09-06)** — `modify_scs` `add_component` / `modify_component` now reach the property-applying implementation (previously dead-wired); `set_axis_settings` writes the blend-space `BlendParameters`; `advance_simulation` advances `steps` ticks once instead of `steps²`; `simplify_mesh` no longer divides by zero on an empty mesh; `add_landscape_layer` honours `save`; `save_level_as` no longer requires `ULevelEditorSubsystem`; `create_light`, unknown World Partition actions, session-settings refusals and the audio playback no-editor path all answer with a receipt instead of falling through; `create_switch_actor` etc. keep their single namespace implementation.
- **Source compatibility restored across the supported UE 5.0–5.8 range.** Several engine APIs and relocated headers were used without guards, and several existing guards named the wrong engine boundary, so the plugin failed to compile on parts of the range it advertises. Header selection now probes with `__has_include` instead of hard-coded version numbers wherever the engine moved a header, and the remaining guards were corrected against the engine source. Affected areas: the StructUtils headers (`MCP_USER_DEFINED_STRUCT_HEADER`, `MCP_INSTANCED_STRUCT_HEADER`), `FAssetCompilingManager::FinishCompilationForObjects`, `UWidgetBlueprint::WidgetVariableNameToGuidMap`, `CreateNewIKRigAsset`, `FString::RightChopInline`/`LeftInline`, and `PhysicsEngine/SkeletalBodySetup.h`. A redundant `UObject/StrProperty.h` include was dropped (`FStrProperty` comes from the already-included `UObject/UnrealType.h`).
- **Render console handler** — use `FJsonObject::HasField()` instead of `Values.Contains(FString)`, following the `FJsonObject::Values` key-type change.
- **Asset soft-path fallback returned the wrong string shape** — `MCP_ASSET_DATA_GET_SOFT_PATH` used `PackageName` (`/Game/Foo`) where callers expected an object path (`/Game/Foo.Foo`). It now uses `FAssetData::ObjectPath`, the equivalent of the `GetSoftObjectPath()` used in the other branch.
- **`validate_niagara_system` now reports real errors** — previously hard-coded `isValid=true`; it now builds a full Niagara system view model and harvests stack issues (e.g. "The module has unmet dependencies.") across the system and emitter stacks. A data-processing-only view model can't be used because `UNiagaraStackModuleItem::RefreshIssues()` emits no per-module issues in that mode.
- **IK Rigs created on the `NewObject` fallback path are registered with the asset registry** — `FAssetRegistryModule::AssetCreated()` is now called explicitly on that branch, which the static factory does for us on engines that have it. Without it the rig existed on disk but was unregistered, so it never appeared in the Content Browser until an unrelated rescan happened to pick it up: the asset looked lost even though creation had reported success.
- **Widget GUID registration logs a truthful no-op** — `RegisterWidgetGuid`, `UnregisterWidgetGuid`, and `RegisterAnimationGuid` each logged "registered"/"unregistered" on engine versions that have no `WidgetVariableNameToGuidMap`, claiming work they had not done. On those versions the engine owns the widget variable's GUID in `UBlueprint::NewVariables[].VarGuid`, and writing our own would overwrite a value existing bindings resolve through — so a no-op is correct, it just has to say so. `RegisterAnimationGuid` still adds the animation to `WidgetBP->Animations`, which is the part that matters there.
- **Bare `remove_variable` / `rename_variable` now match on the native transport** — the Blueprint variable removal/rename handler matched only the `blueprint_`-prefixed forms, so the bare action names fell through unhandled. Both the snake_case (`remove_variable`, `rename_variable`) and alphanumeric-lowered (`removevariable`, `renamevariable`) bare forms are now accepted alongside the prefixed ones.
- **Every texture call was failing** — `action` is injected by the consolidated routing layer (`WithPayloadSubAction`) as the legacy dispatch verb, but it is not a client parameter and was absent from the handlers' `ValidParams` allowlists, so schema-valid texture calls were rejected with `TEXTURE_ERROR: Invalid parameter: action`. Added to all five affected handlers (gradient, noise, normal, pattern, resize).
- **`add_variable` now applies `defaultValue`** — the handler read the payload field but never assigned it, so every variable was created with a zero/empty default. The parsed default is written to `FBPVariableDescription::DefaultValue` with type-aware formatting (booleans lowercased, integer/byte categories as whole numbers, floats via `SanitizeFloat`, strings and struct literals passed through).
- **`ListenPorts` drop warning** — when multi-listen is on and a partial `ListenPorts` override omits a default bridge port (8090/8091), a warning is logged instead of the drop being silent (the user's ports stay authoritative).
- **Clean build fixed** — the memreport scan passed `256` as a seventh argument to `IFileManager::FindFilesRecursive`, but that parameter is `bClearFileNames`, not a result ceiling, so the call did not compile. The bound was dropped rather than reworked: truncating is also wrong here, since picking the newest of an arbitrary subset can miss the actual newest report. A real traversal bound would need `IterateDirectoryStatRecursively`, which can stop early and read `ModificationTime` in the same pass.
- **Last source warning cleared** — `FLinearColor ColorValue;` left its channels uninitialized in the cinematics material-parameter track handler, and the only writer runs on one branch, so the compiler could not correlate the write with the guarded use and warned C4701. Seeded to opaque black, matching `ReadLinearColor`'s own defaults.
- Wait for actual replay seek completion, keep render ownership until executor settlement, roll back Take Recorder panel/source state after asynchronous failures, reject invalid render limits before queue mutation, and verify tokenized render filenames.
- **Compatibility sweep beyond the earlier fix** — the `MCP_HAS_IKRETARGETER_SET_IKRIG_ENUM` boundary was reversed because the minor it named sat on the wrong side, and three shims were added for APIs that differ across the supported range (`MCP_SET_ENUMS`, `MCP_HAS_GET_OBJECTS_FLAGS`/`MCP_GET_OBJECTS_NO_NESTED`, `MCP_DISALLOW_SHRINKING`). Fourteen files move off `FJsonObject::Values` lookups with an `FString` key onto `HasField()` for the UE 5.8 key-type change, the ambiguous `TEXT("ReadOnly")` comparison is qualified, the diagnostics filename no longer trips C2084, `bCompileForEdit` (a member added in 5.6, absent on 5.5) is guarded in the shared Niagara stack-issue collector, and the Fab calls follow the engine's current API surface.
- **Domain correctness fixes** — a property that cannot be coerced answers `PROPERTY_CONVERSION_FAILED` with `partial: true` for the fields that did apply, an unknown World Partition action answers `UNKNOWN_ACTION` instead of falling through, and the pipeline status report states what it measured rather than a hardcoded value.

### Verification
- **Supports Unreal Engine 5.0–5.8.** The range is a source-compatibility target: per-version build and live-editor results are not asserted here. See `docs/performance-and-evidence.md` for the engine matrix and what each version's record actually shows.

### Migration
- The internal `manage_post_process` C++ action has been folded into the expanded `manage_render` action (the `Render/McpAutomationBridge_RenderPostProcess*.cpp` files now dispatch through `manage_render`). Any client that called `manage_post_process` directly will now fail with `does not match prefix` — switch to `manage_render` and pass the desired sub-action via `subAction`. The reflection-capture resolution setter was renamed from `configure_capture_resolution` to `configure_reflection_capture_resolution`; the scene-capture path keeps the original `configure_capture_resolution` name. The `McpAutomationBridge_RenderHandlers.cpp` monolith is now a 74-line dispatcher; per-concern handlers live under `Render/McpAutomationBridge_Render*.cpp`.

## [0.5.30] - 2026-06-05

### Security
- **Capability token enforcement** on native MCP transport — validates `X-MCP-Capability-Token` header when `bRequireCapabilityToken` is enabled (mirrors WebSocket bridge logic)
- **Symlink escape prevention** in `execute_python` file path validation — resolves symlinks and re-validates against project directory
- **Code size limit** in `execute_python` — enforces 1 MB maximum for inline code payloads
- **Explicit request origin tracking** (`ERequestOrigin`) — routes HTTP vs WebSocket responses by explicit origin instead of inferring from `TargetSocket==nullptr`
- **Tool registry thread safety** — `Register()` now holds `CacheMutex` for entire body, `GetAllTools()` returns copy to prevent external mutation
- **Dynamic tool manager protection** — `EnableCategory("all")` now respects protected categories and initial state instead of blindly enabling everything

### Added — Native MCP Streamable HTTP Transport
- **Native MCP endpoint** (`POST /mcp`) directly inside the C++ plugin — AI clients connect without the TypeScript bridge
- **SSE streaming** for `tools/call` — progress notifications arrive in real-time, followed by final JSON-RPC result
- **Raw socket HTTP server** (`FRunnable` + `FSocket`) replacing `FHttpServerModule` — no external dependencies
- **JSON-RPC 2.0** protocol (MCP 2025-03-26) with `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` methods
- **Multiple concurrent sessions** — Cursor, Claude Code, and other clients can connect simultaneously
- **Session management** with `Mcp-Session-Id` header, 1-hour inactivity timeout, `DELETE /mcp` termination
- **Dynamic tool manager** — enable/disable tools and categories at runtime via `manage_tools`
- **Native tool schemas** generated from self-describing C++ tool classes with full `inputSchema` and categories (core, world, authoring, gameplay, utility); the TypeScript bridge exposes 23 canonical parent MCP tools.
- **`listChanged` notifications** — broadcast `notifications/tools/list_changed` to all active SSE connections when tool state changes
- **Load All Tools on Start** project setting — toggle between the core set and all available native tool schemas at startup
- **Status bar indicator** — `● MCP :3000 (2)` in UE editor status bar, click to open settings
- **Server identity config** — `server-info.json` for name/version/instructions, plus `NativeMCPInstructions` project setting for custom instructions
- **Client info logging** — log connecting client name and version from `initialize` request
- **`execute_python` action** in `system_control` — execute Python code with stdout/stderr capture, supports inline `code` and `file` path, execution time tracking
- **Shared `ListenHost` setting** — native MCP respects `AllowNonLoopback` for network access control
- **Plugin-packaging scripts** for Win/Mac/Linux — build and package the plugin via RunUAT BuildPlugin, with smart arg parsing
- **Expanded environment systems coverage** — heightmap import/export, landscape layer info/material/splines/LOD/streaming proxies, foliage type configuration/paint/remove flows, sky/volumetric-cloud/weather/wind/time-of-day setup, water bodies, water waves/material/collision, and buoyancy components

### Changed
- Plugin descriptor metadata updated to `0.5.30` to match the server/source release version.
- Tool categories now use four groups: `core`, `world`, `gameplay`, and `utility`. The singleton `authoring` category was removed, and `manage_blueprint` moved into `core`.
- `manage_blueprint` schema: `location`, `rotation`, `scale` changed from flat number arrays to structured objects with named sub-fields (`x`/`y`/`z` or `pitch`/`yaw`/`roll`) — matches TypeScript schema
- `system_control` schema: removed `export_asset` action (not in TypeScript schema) and `additionalArgs` parameter (C++-only, never used by TS clients)
- `control_editor` schema: added `set_editor_mode` action (was missing from C++, present in TS)
- Screenshot handler: now returns `async: true` with `expectedDelay` field and timing guidance for polling
- `ScanPathsSynchronous` removed from asset query/workflow handlers to prevent GameThread blocking — documented limitation: newly-added assets may not appear until editor rescan
- Temp file cleanup in `execute_python` uses RAII scope guard for guaranteed cleanup on all exit paths

### Fixed
- `reset` action now restores initial state from `Initialize()` instead of enabling all tools unconditionally
- UE 5.6 compatibility: `TSharedPtr` for incomplete types, `Headers.Add` instead of `SetHeader`, `TryGetField` return value
- Package script arg parsing — flags no longer eaten as output directory, extra args correctly forwarded to RunUAT
- Build-environment action routing and validation now cover the expanded landscape, foliage, sky/weather, water, and buoyancy actions across native and TypeScript surfaces

### Technical Details
- Response routing via explicit `ERequestOrigin` enum (`NativeHTTP` vs `WebSocket`) — no more `TargetSocket==nullptr` inference
- Thread-safe SSE writes: per-connection `WriteMutex`, snapshot pattern for broadcast
- Thread-safe tool registry: `CacheMutex` protects `Tools`, `ToolsByName`, `CachedToolSchemas`, `bCacheValid`
- Opt-in via `bEnableNativeMCP` project setting (default: off)
- Capability token validation mirrors WebSocket bridge (`McpConnectionManager.cpp`)
